Therefore, the foundation of any audio analysis algorithm is a representation that is structured around time and frequency.</p><p>In audio signal processing an important property of time and frequency transform is invertibility which means that the original audio signal or a very close approximation can be reconstructed from the values of the transform. </p><p>As the goal of audio feature extraction is analysis, typically a lot of information needs to be discarded and therefore perfect reconstruction is not as important.</p><h3 id="DFT"><a href="#DFT" class="headerlink" title="DFT"></a>DFT</h3><p>The <strong>DFT</strong> has its origins in the Fourier series in which any complicated continuous periodic function can be written as an infinite discrete sum of sine and cosine signals. Similarly, the <strong>DFT</strong> can be viewed as a similar process of representing any finite, discrete signal (properties required for processing by a computer) by a finite, discrete sum of discretized sine and cosine signals.</p><h3 id="STFT"><a href="#STFT" class="headerlink" title="STFT"></a>STFT</h3><p>The short-time Fourier transform (<strong>STFT</strong>) is arguably the most common time-frequency representation and has been widely used in many domains in addition to music processing. In addition, other audio feature representations such as the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (<strong>MFCCs</strong>) and chroma are based on the <strong>STFT</strong>. An important factor in the wide use of the <strong>STFT</strong> is the high speed with which it can be computed in certain cases when using the fast Fourier transform (<strong>FFT</strong>)  algorithm.</p><p>The fundamental idea behind the short-time Fourier transform (<strong>STFT</strong>) as well as many other time-frequency representations is to express a signal as a linear combination of basic elementary signals that can be more easily understood and manipulated. </p><p>It is possible to calculate the DFT of an entire audio clip and show how the energy of the signal is distributed among different frequencies. However, such an analysis would provide no information about when these frequencies start and stop in time. The idea behind the STFT is to process small segments of the audio clip at a time and the DFT of each segment. The output of the DFT is called a spectrum. The resulting sequence of spectrums (or spectra) contains information about time as well as frequency. The process of obtaining a small segment from a long audio signal can be viewed as a multiplication of the original audio signal with signal that has the value 1 during the time period of interest and the value 0 outside it. Such a signal is called a rectangular window.</p>]]></content>

The resulting changes in air pressure can be represented as a continuous signal over time. In order to represent the continuous process in a finite amount of memory the continuous signal is sampled at regular periodic intervals. The resulting sequence of samples which still has continuous values is then converted to a sequence of discretised samples through the process of quantization. </p><ul><li>Example</li></ul><p>CD quality audio has a sampling rate of 44,100 Hz and a dynamic range of 16 bit. This means each second of sound is represented as 44,100 samples equally spaced in time and each one of those samples is represented by 16 bits.</p><h3 id="Nyquist-Shannon-sampling-theorem"><a href="#Nyquist-Shannon-sampling-theorem" class="headerlink" title="Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem"></a>Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem</h3><p>If a function $x(t)$ contains no frequencies higher than $B$ Hertz, it can be completely reconstructed from a series of points spaced $\frac{1}{2B}$ seconds apart.</p><p>What this means is that if the highest frequency we are interested in is $B$ Hertz then we need to sample the signal at $2B$ Hertz or higher. As the data rates of audio signals are very high this has important implications.</p><ul><li>Example</li></ul><p>Telephone quality speech typically has a sampling rate of 16,000 Hz whereas CD audio has 44,100 Hz.</p><h3 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a>Reference</h3><p>[1] Howard, David M., and Jamie Angus. <em>Acoustics and psychoacoustics</em>.
